# Blockchain-Final-Year-Project

### ABSTRACT: 

Many sectors, like finance, medicine, manufacturing, and education, use blockchain applications to profit from the unique bundle of characteristics of this technology. Blockchain technology (BT) promises benefits in trustability, collaboration, organization, identification, credibility, and transparency. In this project, we conduct an analysis in which we show how open science can benefit from this technology and its properties. For this, we determined the requirements of an open science ecosystem and compared them with the characteristics of BT to prove that the technology suits as an infrastructure. We will use Blockchain here for secure transactions of money between friends. 

Transaction between friends is secured by using blockchain technology. Here we will see how the transaction is secured and protected. Project is in python Programming. 
Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.
A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participantâ€™s ledger. 
Blocks
Every chain consists of multiple blocks and each block has three basic elements:
The data in the block. A 32-bit whole number called a nonce. The nonce is randomly generated when a block is created, which then generates a block header hash. The hash is a 256-bit number wedded to the nonce. It must start with a huge number of zeroes (i.e., be extremely small). When the first block of a chain is created, a nonce generates the cryptographic hash. The data in the block is considered signed and forever tied to the nonce and hash unless it is mined.

### Software Requirements:

Python IDE(Online/Offline) 

 We will Mainly use Google Collab for better performance, easy execution and platform Independent.

### Hardware Requirements: 

Any Hardware as Mobile, Ipad, Laptop or Desktop will work

Programming: Project will be in Python Programming.
